sensehat-weather-monitor
Introduction
This project demonstrates a weather monitor using the SenseHAT add-on board for Raspberry Pi. It measures temperature, pressure, and humidity, and displays the data in real-time using a Dash web application. The sensor data is also stored in a MongoDB database for historical analysis.

Architecture
SenseHAT Weather Monitor Architecture

Sensor Data Collection
The sensor_handler.py script periodically collects data from the SenseHAT board and stores it in a MongoDB database. The data collected includes temperature, pressure, and humidity.

Database
A MongoDB database is used to store the sensor data. The sensor data is stored in a collection named weather.

Web Application
The web application is built using the Dash framework, which is a Python library for creating analytical web applications. The application consists of the following components:

Temperature, pressure, and humidity gauges
4-hour historical line charts for each parameter
The web application updates the displayed data every 30 seconds.

Dash Application Layout
The Dash application layout consists of a Bootstrap container with three main sections:

Header with the title "SenseHat Weather Monitor"
Row with three columns for displaying the current temperature, pressure, and humidity
Two rows, each containing three columns with graphs for displaying the historical data
Updating the Data
The update_values function is triggered by the interval component every 30 seconds. This function fetches the latest data from the MongoDB database and updates the gauges and historical line charts in the web application.

Running the Application
To run the application, execute the app.py script.
'''python app.py'''
